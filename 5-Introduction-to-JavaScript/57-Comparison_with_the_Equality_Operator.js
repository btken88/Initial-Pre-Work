//I learned what the equality operator (==) is and how it's different from the assignment operator (=). I also learned that java will compare different data types like a number by itself and a number in a string.
// Setup
function testEqual(val) {
  if (val == 12) { // Change this line
    return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}

// Change this value to test
testEqual(10);
