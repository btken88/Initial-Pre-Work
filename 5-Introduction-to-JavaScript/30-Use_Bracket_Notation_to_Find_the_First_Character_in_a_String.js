//I learned you can use bracket notation to refer to a specific index or character location within a string. It uses base 0, meaning the first character would be index 0.
// Example
var firstLetterOfFirstName = "";
var firstName = "Ada";

firstLetterOfFirstName = firstName[0];

// Setup
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0];
